# Getting started with HotMeals

DEAR EVERYONE - There are currently no open tickets! We are still in the process of laying out the exact plan for the front-end. We won't be approving code-related PR's YET. The code submission guidelines tickets, plans, etc are coming soon! Please bare with us, as we are working out the kinks as we go along! Thanks for coming here, and we can't wait to see how everyone of you will contribute! Please feel free to reach out to any of the admins on the Discord channel with any questions/concerns/ideas/etc 

https://discord.gg/a2MxcUmU

For now, since we are still setting up and not doing any coding, please open an issue you'd like to create a PR for, so we can review the issue, and once it is approved, please feel free to then open PR's for the issue(s). Thank you everyone!!!

In the project directory, you can run:
### Npm 
```
