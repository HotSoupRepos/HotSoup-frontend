# Getting started with HotMeals

DEAR EVERYONE - There are currently no open tickets! We are still in the process of laying out the exact plan for the front-end. We won't be approving code-related PR's YET. The code submission guidelines tickets, plans, etc are coming soon! Please bare with us, as we are working out the kinks as we go along! Thanks for coming here, and we can't wait to see how everyone of you contribute! 

For now, since we are still setting up and not doing any coding, please open an issue for it to be reviewed, and then we can open PR's for the issues. Thank you everyone!!!

In the project directory, you can run:
### Npm 
```
npm install
```

Or

### Yarn 
```
yarn install
```

to add node_modules
